        <p>McDonald's predominantly sells hamburgers, various types of chicken, chicken sandwiches, French fries, soft
            drinks, shakes, breakfast items, and desserts. In most markets, McDonald's offers salads and vegetarian
            items, wraps and other localized fare. On a seasonal basis, McDonald's offers the McRib sandwich.[46] During
            March of each year, McDonald's offers a Shamrock Shake to honor Saint Patrick's Day.[47] The company often
            introduces items temporarily or brings them back after long absences.[48][49]</p>
        <p>In addition, the chain also sells some items within the United States on a regional basis; for example, the
            Hatch Green Chile Double Cheeseburger, which is topped with New Mexico green chile, is only available in the
            southwestern state of New Mexico.[50][51]</p>

        <p>The oldest operating McDonald's restaurant is the third one built, opened in 1953. It is located at 10207
            Lakewood Blvd. at Florence Ave. in Downey, California (at 33.9471°N 118.1182°W)</p>
        <p>In 2006, McDonald's introduced its "Forever Young" brand by redesigning all of its restaurants, the first
            significant redesign since the 1970s.[40][41] It resembles a coffee shop, with wooden tables, faux-leather
            chairs, and muted colors; the red was muted to terracotta, the yellow was shifted to golden for a more
            "sunny" look, and olive and sage green were added. The warmer look has less plastic and more brick and wood,
            with modern hanging lights for a softer glow. Many restaurants feature free Wi-Fi and flat-screen TVs. Other
            upgrades include double drive-thrus, flat roofs instead of the angled red roofs, and fiberglass instead of
            wood. Instead of the familiar golden arches, the restaurants feature "semi-swooshes" (half of a golden
            arch), similar to the Nike swoosh.[42]

            As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, McDonald's closed most seating and all play areas in its United States
            restaurants.[43] It transitioned to drive-thru and curbside orders at locations and online food ordering
            delivery services.[44] In July 2020, for the year's second quarter, McDonald's reported earnings of 66 cents
            per share. Compared to the same period of last year, it represented a fall of 68%.[45]</p>
